üçï Pizza Sales Analysis Project

Overview
This project analyzes pizza sales data from a local restaurant to uncover valuable insights related to sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. The analysis was performed using SQL for data preparation and Power BI for interactive visualizations, utilizing Power Query for data transformation and DAX for custom calculations.

Tools & Technologies
SQL: Data ingestion, cleaning, and KPI calculations
Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation
Power Query: Data transformation and merging of datasets
CSV: Source data format

Project Structure
pizza_sales.csv: The original dataset containing raw sales data.
PizzaSales.sql: SQL file containing queries used for data cleaning, KPI calculations, and data export.
Pizza Sales.pbix: Power BI file with the final dashboard, interactive visuals, and DAX calculations.
Key Steps
Data Ingestion & Cleaning:
The raw sales data was imported into SQL from a CSV file.
SQL queries were used to clean the data, handle missing values, standardize date formats, and remove duplicates.
KPI Calculation:
SQL queries were written to calculate key metrics, such as total sales, average sales per day, top-selling products, and revenue by category.
Power Query Transformation:
After loading the data into Power BI, Power Query was used to further transform the data by merging datasets, reshaping columns, and applying custom fields.
Dashboard Creation:
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with dynamic visuals, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, to showcase key insights.
The dashboard includes slicers and filters to allow users to explore the data by product category, time period, and customer demographics.
Key Insights
Identified top-selling products and peak sales periods, providing actionable insights for inventory management.
Customer segmentation and demographic analysis revealed opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns.
Dynamic KPIs allowed real-time tracking of business performance and trends.
How to Use
SQL Queries: Run the SQL queries provided in the PizzaSales.sql file to replicate the data cleaning and KPI calculations.
Power BI Dashboard: Open the .pbix file in Power BI to explore the interactive dashboard.
Data Source: The dataset (pizza_sales.csv) is included for reference and further analysis.
Future Enhancements
Expand the analysis to include predictive modeling for future sales trends.
Add further customer segmentation to drive personalized marketing strategies.
Integrate with additional data sources (e.g., customer feedback) to enrich the insights.
